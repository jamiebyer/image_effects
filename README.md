# Testing out image manipulation in Rust

## Current function:
- GUI (using FLTK crate) to choose input image.
- Load an image, change the colour of a solid background to black, and then save the new image.

## Future function:
- Choose what kind of background removal to use.
- Display the current selected image (before / after)
- Background removal for non-solid backgrounds.
- Stretch images that aren't head-on to make them square/rectangular.
