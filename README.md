# Testing out image manipulation in Rust

## Current function:
- Loads an image, changes the colour of a solid background to black, and then saves the new image.

## Future function:
- GUI to choose which photo to load, and choose what kind of background removal to use.
- Background removal for non-solid backgrounds.
- Stretch images that aren't head-on to make them square/rectangular.
